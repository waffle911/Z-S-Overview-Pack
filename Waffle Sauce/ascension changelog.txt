• Added new Ascension entities to appropriate PvE presets.
     - All Zenith Hidden (Faction) (Ship) added to Brackets to replicate default overview functionality during the Tutorial.
     - Tutorial Seekers and Zenith Hidden (Faction) Capitals added to appropriate presets to replicate default functionality during Tutorial.
• Added Superweapon and Effect beacons to all presets I could think of that one might be using when SUDDENLY TITAN.
• Added Mission (Faction) (Ship) entities to PvE presets that didn't have them because seriously why didn't they have them, they're PvE presets.
     - Dagan and his escorts should now show up in PvE presets. I hope.
• Corrected a typo that prevented the PvP CovOps Collidable preset from loading when applying individual packs via in-game links.
• Added Industrial Complexes to presets that also show Citadels.
• Added the ability to turn on ship names in ship brackets without breaking them. Ship names remain turned off by default because they serve no tactical purpose, but at least when they're turned on now they look nice and add flavor.
